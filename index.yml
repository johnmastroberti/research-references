  title: Fast component re-emission in Xe-doped liquid argon
  gist: Effect of Xe doping on PSD
  url: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00836
  abstract: >
    We present the first direct experimental confirmation of the fast
    component re-emission in liquid argon (LAr) doped with xenon (Xe). This
    effect was studied at various Xe concentrations up to ∼ 3000 ppm. The
    rate constant of energy transfer for the fast component was quantified.
    It was shown that LAr doped with a high concentration of Xe without TPB
    has a better Pulse Shape Discrimination (PSD) efficiency than pure LAr or
    Xe-doped LAr with TPB. The stability of LAr+Xe mixture was tested for the
    first time at high Xe concentration for long continuous runtimes.

    Measurements of the intrinsic quantum efficiency and absorption length of
    tetraphenyl butadiene thin films in the vacuum ultraviolet regime
  gist: Efficiency and absorption length of TPB vs wavelength
  url: https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-5807-z
  abstract: >
    A key enabling technology for many liquid noble gas (LNG) detectors is the
    use of the common wavelength shifting medium tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB).
    TPB thin films are used to shift ultraviolet scintillation light into the
    visible spectrum for detection and event reconstruction. Understanding the
    wavelength shifting efficiency and optical properties of these films are
    critical aspects in detector performance and modeling and hence in the
    ultimate physics sensitivity of such experiments. This article presents the
    first measurements of the room-temperature microphysical quantum efficiency
    for vacuum-deposited TPB thin films – a result that is independent of the
    optics of the TPB or substrate. Also presented are measurements of the
    absorption length in the vacuum ultraviolet regime, the secondary
    re-emission efficiency, and more precise results for the “black-box”
    efficiency across a broader spectrum of wavelengths than previous results.
    The low-wavelength sensitivity, in particular, would allow construction of
    LNG scintillator detectors with lighter elements (Ne, He) to target light
    mass WIMPs.

    Index of refraction, Rayleigh scattering length, and Sellmeier coefficients
    in solid and liquid argon and xenon
  gist: RINDEX and Rayleigh scattering length of Ar vs wavelength
  url: https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04213v4
  abstract: >
    Large liquid argon detectors have become widely used in low rate
    experiments, including dark matter and neutrino research. However, the
    optical properties of liquid argon are not well understood at the large
    scales relevant for current and near-future detectors.The index of
    refraction of liquid argon at the scin- tillation wavelength has not been
    measured, and current Rayleigh scattering length calculations disagree with
    measurements. Furthermore, the Rayleigh scattering length and index of
    refraction of solid argon and solid xenon at their scintillation
    wavelengths have not been previously measured or calculated. We introduce a
    new calculation using existing data in liquid and solid argon and xenon to
    extrapolate the optical properties at the scintillation wavelengths using
    the Sellmeier dispersion relationship.

    Attenuation length measurements of scintillation light in liquid rare gases
    and their mixtures using an improved reflection suppresser
  gist: Attenuation length measurements for Lar and XeDLAr
  url: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-9002(96)00740-1
  abstract: >
    The attenuation lengths for scintillation photons in liquid argon, krypton,
    xenon, argon-xenon (3%) mixture, and krypton-xenon (3%) mixture, have been
    measured by using a newly designed reflection suppresser. The obtained
    values are 66±3 cm for argon, 82±4 cm for krypton, 29±2 cm for xenon,
    170±23 cm (first experiment) and 118±10 cm (second experiment) for
    argon-xenon (3%) mixture, and 136±11 cm for krypton-xenon (3%) mixture. The
    reason why the attenuation lengths in the mixtures are longer than those in
    the pure liquids is attributed to the reduced Rayleigh scattering in the
    mixtures.

  abstract: >
    Wavelength shifters and their applications for liquid argon detectors have
    been a subject of extensive R&D procedures over the past decade. This work
    reviews the most recent results in this field. We compare the optical
    properties and usage details together with the associated challenges for
    various wavelength shifting solutions. We discuss the current status and
    potential future R&D directions for the main classes of wavelength
    shifters.

  title: Large-Scale, Precision Xenon Doping of Liquid Argon
  gist: Triplet lifetime in XeDLAr
  url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09780
  abstract: >
    The detection of scintillation light from liquid argon is an experimental
    technique key to a number of current and future nuclear/particle physics
    experiments, such as neutrino physics, neutrinoless double beta decay and
    dark matter searches. Although the idea of adding small quantities of xenon
    (doping) to enhance the light yield has attracted considerable interest,
    this technique has never been demonstrated at the necessary scale or
    precision. Here we report on xenon doping in a 100 l cryogenic vessel.
    Xenon doping was performed in four concentrations of 1.00±0.06 ppm, 2.0±0.1
    ppm, 5.0±0.3 ppm, and 10.0±0.5 ppm. These measurements represent the most
    precise xenon doping measurements as of publishing. We observed an increase
    in average light yield by a factor of 1.92±0.12(syst)±0.02(stat) at a
    dopant concentration of 10 ppm.

  title: Intense VUV and Infrared Scintillation of Liquid Ar-Xe Mixtures
  gist: Shift of scintillation wavelength to 174 nm, time constants
  url: https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07723v1
  abstract: >
    Vacuum ultraviolet light emission from xenon-doped liquid argon is
    described in the context of liquid noble gas particle detectors. Xenon
    concentrations in liquid argon from 0.1 ppm to 1000 ppm were studied. The
    energy transfer from the second excimer continuum of argon (∼127 nm) to the
    second excimer continuum of xenon (∼174 nm) is observed by recording
    optical emission spectra. The transfer almost saturates at a xenon
    concentration of ∼10 ppm for which, in addition, an intense emission in the
    infrared at a peak wavelength of 1.17 μm with (13000±4000) photons per MeV
    deposited by electrons had been found. The corresponding value for the VUV
    emission at a peak wavelength of 174 nm (second excimer continuum of xenon)
    is determined to be (20000±6000) photons per MeV electron energy deposited.
    Under these excitation conditions pure liquid argon emits (22000±3000)
    photons per MeV electron energy deposited at a peak wavelength of 127nm. An
    electron-beam induced emission spectrum for the 10 ppm Ar-Xe liquid mixture
    ranging from 115 nm to 3.5 μm is presented. VUV emission spectra from
    xenon-doped liquid argon with exponentially varied xenon concentrations
    from 0.1 ppm to 1000 ppm are also shown. Time structure measurements of the
    light emissions at well-defined wavelength positions in the vacuum
    ultraviolet as well as in the near-infrared are presented.

  title: Scintillation and optical properties of xenon-doped liquid argon
  gist: Measurement of triplet lifetime and attenuation length in XeDLAr
  url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07427
  abstract: >
    Liquid argon (LAr) is a common choice as detection medium in particle
    physics and rare- event searches. Challenges of LAr scintillation light
    detection include its short emission wavelength, long scintillation time
    and short attenuation length. The addition of small amounts of xenon to LAr
    is known to improve the scintillation and optical properties. We present a
    characterization campaign on xenon-doped liquid argon (XeDLAr) with target
    xenon concentrations ranging from 0 to 300 ppm by mass encompassing the
    measurement of the photoelectron yield 𝑌 , effective triplet lifetime 𝜏3
    and effective attenuation length 𝜆att . The measurements were conducted in
    the Subterranean Cryogenic ARgon Facility, Scarf, a 1 t (XeD)LAr test stand
    in the shallow underground laboratory (UGL) of TU-Munich. These three
    scintillation and optical parameters were observed simultaneously with a
    single setup, the Legend Liquid Argon Monitoring Apparatus, Llama. The
    actual xenon concentrations in the liquid and gaseous phases were
    determined with the Impurity DEtector For Investigation of Xenon, Idefix, a
    mass spectrometer setup, and successful doping was confirmed. At the
    highest dopant concentration we find a doubling of 𝑌 , a tenfold reduction
    of 𝜏3 to ∼ 90 ns and a tenfold increase of 𝜆att to over 6 m.

    First detection of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering on an argon
    target
  gist: Jacob Z's thesis
  url: https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/25448
  abstract: >
    Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) was first proposed in
    1974 but eluded detection for 40 years. The COHERENT collaboration made the
    first observation of CEvNS at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Spallation
    Neutron Source (SNS) with a 14.6 kg CsI[Na] detector. One of the physics
    goals of the COHERENT experiment is to test the square of the neutron
    number dependence of the CEvNS cross section predicted in the Standard
    Model by observing CEvNS in multiple nuclei. To that end, the ~24 kg
    CENNS-10 liquid argon detector was deployed at the low-background Neutrino
    Alley at the SNS in early 2017. The detector was upgraded to allow for
    sensitivity to CEvNS in mid-2017. We analyzed 1.5 years of data taken after
    this upgrade to provide the first detection of CEvNS on an argon nucleus at
    > 3σ significance. The measured CEvNS cross section of (2.3±0.7) x 1039cm2,
    averaged over the incident neutrino flux, is consistent with the Standard
    Model prediction. This result represents a detection of CEvNS on the
    lightest nuclei so far and improves bounds on beyond-the-standard-model
    physics in the form of non-standard neutrino interactions.
